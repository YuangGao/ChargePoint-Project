# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project is an example of customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The aim is to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior, in order to better understand their needs and preferences.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Approach

The project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform dimension reduction on the customer data. Then, K-Means clustering is used to segment the customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. Finally, a predictive model is built using supervised learning algorithms to predict the cluster of a new customer based on their purchasing behavior.
